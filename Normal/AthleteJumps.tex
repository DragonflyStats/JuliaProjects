\noindent The length of the jump of an athlete has a normal distribution with mean 7m and standard deviation 0.1m. 



\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item 
	Calculate the probability that he jumps at least 7.15m
	
\item 
	Calculate the probability that he jumps between 6.9 and 7.05m
	
\item 
	Find the probability that if he jumps 3 times all the jumps will be less than 7.15m. (Assume the lengths of the jumps are independent and use the answer to first part).  
	
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Solutions}

\[ X \sim N(\mu = 7.00,  \sigma^2 = 0.1^2 )\]


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Determine $P(X \geq 7.15) $               
\[Zo=\frac{Xo-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{7.15 - 7.00}{0.10}=\frac{0.15}{0.10}=1.50\]

From tables $P(Z\geq 1.50) = 0.0668$. \\        
Therefore $P(X\geq 7.15) = 0.0668$.

\item Determine $P(6.9\leq X \leq 7.05)$


\[P(6.90 \leq X \leq 7.05) = 1 - P(X\leq 6.90 ) - P(X \geq 7.05 )\]
\begin{itemize}
\item $P(X\geq 7.05 ) = P(Z \leq 0.50 ) = 0.3085 $  
\item $P(X\leq 6.90 ) = P(Z \leq -1 )= P(Z \geq 1 ) = 0.1586$
\end{itemize}
\[P(6.90 \leq X \leq 7.05) = 1 - (0.1586 + 0.3085) = 0.5328\]      
\noindent \textit{(Remark: Be sure to explain the rationale behind this approach.)}.
\item             
$P(X\leq 7.15) = 0.9332$\\         Probability = $(0.9332)^3= 0.8127$

\end{enumerate}
